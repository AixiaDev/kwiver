 * \brief Config file parser.
 *
 * This class converts config file contents into a single config
 * block.  The intent is that this parser creates one config block
 * from desired inputs.  Delete the object when done. Allocate another
 * if another config block is needed.
 *
 * Files specified on the include directive are found by scanning the
 * search path. If they are not found on that path then the directory
 * of the config file that contains the include directive is checked.
 *
 * The file passed to the parse_config() directory are taken as is and
 * not searched for in the path. This file should have already been
 * located by the calling logic.
 *
 * Example code:
\code
std::auto< kwiver::vital::config_parser> input_config( new kwiver::vital::config_parser() );
input_config->add_search_path( "../config" );
input_config->parse_config( filename );
// Optionally, additional files can be parsed into the same config block.
kwiver::vital::config_block_sptr blk = input_config->get_config();
\endcode
