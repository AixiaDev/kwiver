KWIVER release 0.2.0
====================

Named 0.2.0 since we released vital 0.1.0 and do not want this release
to be confused with that one. Libraries will tagged with version
number and we will not be able to distinguish libvital-0.1.0 from
vital release from libvital-0.1.0 from kwiver release.

Changes
=======

-- SQX -

- added sprokit process endcaps in arrows/processes/adapters. These
  adapters provide a way of injecting data into a sprokit pipeline.

- added processes to support detection filtering and dsplay.

-- AFRL -

- Added support for specifying scheduler type in a config file.

- Move schedulers from examples directory to scchedulers directory.

- Refactored pipeline_bakery source into separate class files. This
  improves readability and maintainability.

- Added generic plugin manager to support loading arbitrary classes,
  rather than processes or algorithms.

- Added plugin using generic plugin management to support process
  instrumentation.

- Removed unused and/or unneeded header files, particularly headers
  for process registration.

- Reorganized plugin related diagnostic tools. Renamed plugin_explorer
  to algo_explorer and created new tool, plugin_explorer for new
  generic plugins.

- Fixed CMake build system bugs.

- Move symbol demangling support into vital. Convert sprokit to use
  that version. Check for demangle support in build system.

- Add RightTrack instrumentation to kwiver/extras directory. This
  serves as a sample of how to write a instrumentation provider. Add
  instrumentation to sample processes as a example.

- Unified Doxygen documentation generation. Now kwiver documentation
  is on a single directory.

- Add dump config option to the klv_dump tool so the internal
  configuration structure can be determined. This file serves as a
  starting point when writing a new config file for this tool.

- Added new sprokit directive to read vital algorithm config
  files. This is needed to reuse existing configurations.

- General improving diagnostics and documentaion; corrected
  misspellings,
