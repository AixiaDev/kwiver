Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Vital

Arrows - Core

 * Added a detect_features adaptor that applies a filter_features
   algorithm to filter features returned by the detector.  This allows
   a filter to be injected anywhere a detector is normally used.

 * Added an adaptive non-max suppression filter for features points.
   This algorithm provides more uniformity to detected features by
   removing all features within a radius of the strongest points.
   The radius is dynamically adapted to achieve a target point count.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe that was causing
   points to be rejected because cameras were swapped.
