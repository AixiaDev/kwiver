release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Improved triangulate_landmarks implementation with an option to use
   RANSAC for robustness to outliers and additional checks to reject
   poorly constrainted landmarks with minimal view angle variation.

 * Added feature detection that adaptively changes thresholds to detect 
   close to a target number of features in each frame.  Also improves the
   distribution of features across the image with a gridded approach.  

 * Added functions that detect issues in the structure from motion
   solution and correct them.  Issues could be disconnected components
   of cameras, cameras with too little coverage, landmarks without
   enough measurements to constrain them etc.  The corrections typically
   remove offending items.  Only the largest connected map component is
   kept.  Underconstrained landmarks are removed etc.


Fixes since last public release
