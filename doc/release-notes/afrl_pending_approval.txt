KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Implemented the seekable() and seek_frame() methods for the various
   video_input implementations. In general this means most of these
   implementations now support seeking to a specific frame in the video.

 * Implemented a num_frames() method for the various video_input
   implementations. This method returns the number of frames available in
   the video or 0 if the video is not seekable.

 * Expanding the tests for the video_input implementations to test the new
   seek frame functionality.

 * Tests of the video_input implementations now test against new test imagery
   that allows an additional check that the video source is on the correct
   frame. This done using barcodes embedded in the test imagery that encode
   the frame number.
   
 * Added keyframe selection classes.  These facilitate choosing particularly
   important frames in an image sequence and then only doing later operations
   (e.g. structure from motion) on these frames.

Arrows - OpenCV

 * Added an OpenCV based KLT feature tracker.
 
 * Added feature detection if a frame is a keyframe.  

 * Added perspective three point pose estimation.

Arrows - DBoW2

 * Added bag of words image matching based on DBoW2 library.  Includes a new vital
   algorithm base class bag_of_words_matching.


Arrows - VXL

 * Implemented the seekable() and seek_frame() methods for the
   vidl_ffmpeg_video_input video source. This source now supports seeking by
   frame if the underlying video stream supports it.

 * Implemented a num_frames() method for the vidl_ffmpeg_video_input video
   source. This method returns the number of frames available in the video or
   0 if the video is not seekable.

 * Added a test for the vidl_ffmpeg_video_input. This test tests the same
   functionality as the tests for video_input implementations in Core. This
   includes the new seek frame functionality.

Vital

 * Expanded video_input API to include a seek_frame() method which will seek
   the video source to specific frame and a seekable() method which returns
   true if the video source supports frame seeking. This allows
   implementations to support seeking to a specific frame if possible.

 * Added a new abstract algorithm, integrate_depth_maps, for the integration
   of depth map images into an implicit surface volume using truncated signed
   distance functions (TSDF) or similar approaches.
