Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Added a function to clip meshes with a plane.

Arrows - FFMPEG

 * Added metadata handling to FFMPEG implementation of video_input

 * Improved the seek_frame call to seek to a nearby keyframe first before
   advancing to the precise frame requested. This is much faster than running
   through the entire video until hitting the requested frame.

Fixes since last public release
