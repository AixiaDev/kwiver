KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Vital - Algo

 * Changed the callback API on compute_depth to accept a string status
   message.  Integer progress is now interpreted as percent complete
   rather than number of iterations.

Arrows - Core

Arrows - Ceres

Arrows - Super3D

 * Replaced cout and cerr usage in Super3D with vital logger.

 * Improved callback handling in compute_depth.  Callbacks are now more
   frequent providing better progress updates and quicker early termination.
   However, depth maps updates still occur at the slower rate as before.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Arrows - Super3D

 * Fixed mask conversion code to allow both boolean and byte images
   without crashing.

 * Fixed a bug in which the mask was being applied to G-weighting in an
   inverted way from what was expected.
