KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Vital

Arrows - Core

 * Added a detect_features adaptor that applies a filter_features
   algorithm to filter features returned by the detector.  This allows
   a filter to be injected anywhere a detector is normally used.

 * Added an adaptive non-max suppression filter for features points.
   This algorithm provides more uniformity to detected features by
   removing all features within a radius of the strongest points.
   The radius is dynamically adapted to achieve a target point count.

 * Added an option to the fundamental matrix matcher that does a second
   round of filtering to remove outliers with large motion relative to
   most other matches.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe that was causing
   points to be rejected because cameras were swapped.

Arrows - Ceres

 * Fixed an issue in bundle adjustment where intrinsics were optimized
   when shared between fixed and non-fixed cameras.  This resulted in an
   increased error in residual terms of fixed cameras not included in the
   bundle adjustment.  As a result, filtering often removed these points as
   outliers.  It is better to only optimize intrinsics when not shared with
   a fixed camera.

 * Fixed and issue with bundle adjustment regularization in which the
   regularization would dominate the data terms if the scale of the data
   was large.
