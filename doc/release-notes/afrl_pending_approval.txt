KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Improved triangulate_landmarks implementation with an option to use
   RANSAC for robustness to outliers and additional checks to reject
   poorly constrainted landmarks with minimal view angle variation.
   
 * Switched track_set_impl from using a vector to store track_sptr to 
   using an unordered map.  This allows for more efficient search for tracks.
   
 * Set inlier flag for track states during triangulation.  Stored max 
   intersection angle of rays in landmark, a quality metric.
   
 * Extracts ORB descriptors at KLT feature locations.  No longer runs ORB 
   detector.

Arrows - Ceres

 * Added ability to fix either cameras or landmarks in bundle adjustment.  
 * Automatically fixes the gauge if there are not enough fixed cameras or landmarks.

 * Added option to necker reverse only the cameras but not the landmarks.
 
General - 

 * Improved speed of klt/ORB feature tracking by choosing which features
   to track and match with visual vocabulary node ID.  Made klt feature 
   tracker in sprokit return just the most recent tracked features, not
   the entire history at each step.  Made keyframe selector remove non
   keyframes temporally between keyframes to improve speed.  That way
   matcher process needs only get keyframes.  After sprokit klt tracks
   and keyframe orb feature tracks are merged into a single final track set.

 * Added feature detection that adaptively changes thresholds to detect 
   close to a target number of features in each frame.  Also improves the
   distribution of features across the image with a gridded approach.  

 * Added functions that detect issues in the structure from motion
   solution and correct them.  Issues could be disconnected components
   of cameras, cameras with too little coverage, landmarks without
   enough measurements to constrain them etc.  The corrections typically
   remove offending items.  Only the largest connected map component is
   kept.  Underconstrained landmarks are removed etc.

 * Changes to track_set_impl to facilitate passing track changes between
   sprokit processes rather than full track sets for efficiency.
   
Sprokit

 * Changed KLT tracking pipeline to pass track change information between
   processes rather than full track sets for efficiency.
