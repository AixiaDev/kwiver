KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Vital - Algo

 * Changed the callback API on compute_depth to accept a string status
   message.  Integer progress is now interpreted as percent complete
   rather than number of iterations.

 * Added a variant of the integrate_depth_maps API that takes weight images
   along with depth images. This feature was added to include binary image
   masks in the fusion, but it also extends to continuous weight values
   between zero and one.

Arrows - Core

 * Added utility functions to estimate the ground center of landmarks and
   to apply a translational offset to landmarks and cameras.

Arrows - Ceres

Arrows - CUDA

 * CUDA depth map integration now uses optional weight maps to down-weight
   the contribution of some rays.

Arrows - Super3D

 * Replaced cout and cerr usage in Super3D with vital logger.

 * Improved callback handling in compute_depth.  Callbacks are now more
   frequent providing better progress updates and quicker early termination.
   However, depth maps updates still occur at the slower rate as before.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Arrows - Super3D

 * Fixed mask conversion code to allow both boolean and byte images
   without crashing.

 * Fixed a bug in which the mask was being applied to G-weighting in an
   inverted way from what was expected.
