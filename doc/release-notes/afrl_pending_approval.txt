Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Improved triangulate_landmarks implementation with an option to use
   RANSAC for robustness to outliers and additional checks to reject
   poorly constrainted landmarks with minimal view angle variation.

General - 

 * Improved speed of klt/ORB feature tracking by choosing which features
   to tray and match with visual vocabulary node ID.  Made klt feature 
   tracker in sprokit return just the most recent tracked features, notes
   the entire history at each step.  Made keyframe selector remove non
   keyframes temporally between keyframes to improve speed.  That way
   matcher process needs only get keyframes.  After sprokit klt tracks
   and keyframe orb feature tracks are merged into a single final track set.


Fixes since last public release
