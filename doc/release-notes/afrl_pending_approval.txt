KWIVER Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to KWIVER which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Arrows - Core

 * Improved triangulate_landmarks implementation with an option to use
   RANSAC for robustness to outliers and additional checks to reject
   poorly constrainted landmarks with minimal view angle variation.

 * Switched track_set_impl from using a vector to store track_sptr to
   using an unordered map.  This allows for more efficient search for tracks.

 * Set inlier flag for track states during triangulation.  Stored max
   intersection angle of rays in landmark, a quality metric.

 * Extracts ORB descriptors at KLT feature locations.  No longer runs ORB
   detector.

 * When triangulating switch to using squared rerpojection error for
   efficiency.  Optionally pass initial guess for landmark position to
   RANSAC triangulation.  If location is already known or a good guess
   is available this can cut down the RANSAC loops considerably.

 * Optionally estimates a fundamental matrix before loop closure.  Accepts
   a loop only if the number of inlier matches is above a threshold.

 * Improved the efficiency of loop closing and descriptor comparision.

 * Added triangulate_landmarks method that takes a map of tracks rather
   than a track_set_sptr as input.  This is done for efficiency. Using
   the track map we can directly access the track corresponding to a 
   landmark that needs to be triangulated, rather than looping over 
   all tracks.

 * Added an alternative triangulation method based on "Triangulation 
   Made Easy" Lindstrom CVPR 2010.

 * Added a new video_input implementation, video_input_splice, that
   splices multiple video sources together into a single video source. 
   
 * Added a convenience class for storing maps of arbitrary cameras and 
   adapted SfM utils to use it.

Arrows - Ceres

 * Added ability to fix either cameras or landmarks in bundle adjustment.

 * Automatically fixes the gauge if there are not enough fixed cameras or
   landmarks.

 * Added option to necker reverse only the cameras but not the landmarks.

 * Improved speed of klt/ORB feature tracking by choosing which features
   to track and match with visual vocabulary node ID.  Made klt feature
   tracker in sprokit return just the most recent tracked features, not
   the entire history at each step.  Made keyframe selector remove non
   keyframes temporally between keyframes to improve speed.  That way
   matcher process needs only get keyframes.  After sprokit klt tracks
   and keyframe orb feature tracks are merged into a single final track set.

 * Added feature detection that adaptively changes thresholds to detect
   close to a target number of features in each frame.  Also improves the
   distribution of features across the image with a gridded approach.

 * Added functions that detect issues in the structure from motion
   solution and correct them.  Issues could be disconnected components
   of cameras, cameras with too little coverage, landmarks without
   enough measurements to constrain them etc.  The corrections typically
   remove offending items.  Only the largest connected map component is
   kept.  Underconstrained landmarks are removed etc.
   
Arrows CUDA
 * Added CUDA arrow
 
 * Added depth map integration using CUDA. The algorithm takes a set of
   depth maps and associated cameras to produce a volume that a surface
   can be extracted from using an algorithm like marching cubes.

 * Switch from std::map to std::unordered_map for internal bookkeeping for
   efficiency.

General

 * Changes to track_set_impl to facilitate passing track changes between
   sprokit processes rather than full track sets for efficiency.

 * Added additional range helpers indirect and valid.  The former provides
   access to iterators while still allowing a range-based for to be used.  The
   latter filters iteration so that only "valid" items are visited.

Sprokit

 * Changed KLT tracking pipeline to pass track change information between
   processes rather than full track sets for efficiency.

Vital

 * Change the return type of the as_bytes() function on vital::descriptor
   to return a raw pointer to the bytes instead of a vector of bytes.
   This API change avoids many memory copies when comparing descriptors
   at the byte level.

 * Added a sfm_constraints class and pass this to the structure-from-motion
   algorithms (initialize_cameras_landmark, bundle_adjust, optimize_cameras)
   instead of passing the raw metadata.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Arrows - VXL

 * Fixed issue with ffmpeg video source where the frame metadata was not
   getting set correctly.

Arrows - OpenCV

 * Fixed an issue in which feature detector masks were not working as expected
   when values were not exactly 0 and 255 due to lossy compression.
   A threshold at 128 is now applied to force mask values to 0 and 255.

 * Fixed an issue in the FAST detector where too many features were initially
   detected.
