Fixes since v0.1.0
--------------------

Arrows - Core

 * The match_feature_homography class had a bug in which the feature matches
   used in homography estimation indexed into the source features rather than
   the filtered features.  As a result, when a filter was used, the feature
   locations where incorrect causing the algorithm to fail.  The code has now
   been corrected to properly use the filtered feature list.

Vital

 * Updated some outdated comments in feature_set and descriptor_set.
