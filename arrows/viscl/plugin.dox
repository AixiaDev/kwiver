\section sec-vcl-contents Contents
The ARROWS vcl library provides various components by building on
<a href="https://github.com/Kitware/VisCL">VisCL</a>.  VisCL is an experimental
library for feature detection and tracking on a GPU using OpenCL.
<b>VisCL is still very experimental and not recommended for production use at
this time.</b>


\subsection sec-vcl-containers Custom Containers
- \ref vcl::image_container : holds an image in viscl::image format.
- \ref vcl::feature_set : holds a collection of features stored in viscl formats.
- \ref vcl::descriptor_set : holds a collection of descriptors stored in a
               viscl::buffer.
- \ref vcl::match_set : holds a collection of matches stored in a viscl::buffer.


\subsection sec-vcl-algorithm-impls Algorithm Implementations
- \ref vcl::convert_image : used a GPU entry point to upload an image to the GPU
               once instead of for each algorithm that uses the image.
- \ref vcl::detect_features : detect features on the GPU with VisCL.
- \ref vcl::extract_descriptors : extract descriptors on the GPU with VisCL.
- \ref vcl::match_features : track features in a local neighborhood on the GPU with VisCL.
